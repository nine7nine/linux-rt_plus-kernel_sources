I have provided sources so that non-Archlinux users can make use of the kernel, without needing to do all of the required patching manually. I have also included kernel config files, which have sensible defaults - but still may require 
configuration, depending on one's needs.

all of the contained code is provided 'as is', under the GPLv2;
